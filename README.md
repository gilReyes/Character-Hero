# Character Hero

This project was based on the game "Guitar Hero", where the user is presented with a sequence of different letters that are mapped to
push buttons. The letters are appearing at the right of the lcd display and move to the left. The user has to press the corresponding letter that is under the blinking cursor. Each time the user presses the correct letter a green led lights up and increases the score. When the user misses the letter a red led lights up and the score gets decremented. The win condition is to get to 8 points, lose condition its when the user reaches 0 score.
